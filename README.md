Research code for the paper "Sequential Design of Computer Experiments for the Computation of Bayesian Model Evidence"

A more organized implementation of the paper's method is available in my other repository [bali](https://github.com/MichaelSinsbeck/bali). I strongly recommend using that implementation, unless you need to specifically reproduce the experiments from the article.

## Quick start

To run the code, you need the python packages

 * numpy (1.16.4)
 * scipy  (1.3.0)
 * emcee. (2.2.1)

The two scripts 01_computations.py and 02_computations.py run the experiments and generate output data.
The script 03_plots.py processes the output data into tables that can be uses for creating the plots (with pgfplots).


## Folders

 * bbi contains the package for running sequential designs
 * data contains the dataset for the first experiment and the dataset and input-output data for the second experiment
 * ouput contains the output generated by the computations in 01_computations.py and 02_computations.py (content can be reproduced by running these)
 * plotdata contains the files that are generated by 03_plots.py

Due to filesize the input-output-data of experiment 2 is not included in this repository. Please contact the authors, if you need the data.
